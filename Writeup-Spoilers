I'll include this first Quality of Life step because a lot of writeups don't, and it took me a while to learn it. Once you have the machine IP, run:

export TARGET=[machine IP]

It'll save you a lot of annoying 10-key entry later. Anyway, let's run an nmap scan.

nmap -vvvv -A -p- -T5 $TARGET

We get a few open ports: 22, 80, and 445. The latter two are both implementations of Apache and just give us the default page.

At this point, the goal in my head is to find some credentials and pop them into SSH. Let's run a directory enumeration on the HTTP server:

gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -u $TARGET

A few interesting things pop up: /admin, /passwd, and /shadow.

Heading to /passwd or /shadow in our browser gives us a simple base64 string, the same one on each page.

Decoding it, we get the following string: not this easy :D

Cheeky. Let's check out /admin. There's a link to a parent directory, which is just the default page. There's also an id_rsa. Definitely grabbing that.

When we open the id_rsa, though, it doesn't look like a regular rsa... in fact, it looks like more base64:

Trust me it is not this easy..now get back to enumeration :D

I can't believe you've done this.

Alright, maybe we need to go up a level. After all, there are two Apache servers, and we've only been enumerating the directories on port 80 so far.

gobuster dir -u [machine IP]:445 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt

Aaaand I forgot to set the -t flag to 64 so this wouldn't take half an hour. Oh well, nothing to do now but wait...

Oh? Is that a /management directory on port 445's server? Let's just pop over to our browser and take a look-see.

We're greeted with a login page. I tried a couple different SQLi techniques; here's the one that worked for me:

1' or '1'='1';-- -

And now we've got a Traffic Offense Management admin dashboard. <TBC>
